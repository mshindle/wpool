# wpool

A fork of [godoylucase/workers-pool](https://github.com/godoylucase/workers-pool) worker pool implementation with the modification of turing the execute function into a Task interface. Still need to work out the necessity of maintaining an Args parameter for a Job or just enforce custom types and handle Args as the type chooses. 

To be determined for future development...
